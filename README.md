# Enzonic Website Redesign Project

This project outlines a plan to redesign the Enzonic website (www.enzonic.xyz) using HTML and CSS. The plan involves analyzing the existing website, creating a mockup, developing the HTML structure, styling with CSS, testing, and documenting the changes. This README file serves as a guide to the project's steps and deliverables.  The redesign incorporates design inspiration from the Enzonic Futuristic Hub GitHub repository and includes animations.
